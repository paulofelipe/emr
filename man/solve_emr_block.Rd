\usage{
solve_emr_block(
  model,
  scale_alpha = NULL,
  alpha_min = 0.1,
  alpha_max = 0.5,
  triter = 100,
  trace = FALSE,
  maxit = 1e+05,
  tol = 1e-07
)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{a named list with params, variables and equations.}

\item{scale_alpha}{a vector of size 1 or the same number of mcc equations.
The values should be between 0 and 1 and will be used as steplength for updating each undefined variable.}

\item{alpha_min}{a number between 0 and 1 that will be the floor of internally computed steplength if scale_alpha is not provided.}

\item{alpha_max}{a number between 0 and 1 that will be the ceiling of internally computed steplength if scale_alpha is not provided.}

\item{triter}{an integer indicating the frequency that the results for convergence will be displayed.}

\item{trace}{an boolean indicating if convergence numbers should be displayed.}

\item{maxit}{an integer indicating the maximum number of iterations.}

\item{tol}{a number indicating the convergence tolerance.}
}
\value{
Returns data and information about the model and its solution
